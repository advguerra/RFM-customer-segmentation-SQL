# 📊 Customer Segmentation & Revenue Risk Analysis (RFM Model)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model to segment customers and analyze revenue distribution and churn exposure.

The objective of this analysis was to:

- Classify customers based on purchasing behavior
- Measure revenue concentration per segment
- Identify churn risk exposure
- Generate actionable business recommendations

This is a **SQL-only portfolio project**, focused on analytical reasoning and business impact — without the use of BI tools.

- Monetary value

### Analytical Steps

1. Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics
2. Assigned RFM scores
3. Created behavioral customer segments
4. Aggregated total revenue by segment
5. Calculated ARPU (Average Revenue per Customer)
6. Performed revenue risk analysis

# 💰 Revenue Distribution by Segment

| Segment Name        | Total Revenue |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Emerging Customers  | 646,804.21   |
| Lost Customers      | 603,534.05   |
| At Risk             | 555,672.24   |
| Loyal Customers     | 519,082.57   |
| Core Customers      | 398,506.70   |
| Champions           | 212,208.46   |

### Revenue Risk Exposure

Lost + At Risk revenue:

603,534 + 555,672 = **1,159,206**

Over **1.15M in revenue** is associated with churn-prone segments, representing significant financial exposure.

# 🎯 Average Revenue per Customer (ARPU)

| Segment Name        | Customers | Avg Revenue per Customer |
|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Champions           | 329       | 6,450.09                 |
| Core Customers      | 1,321     | 3,017.26                 |
| At Risk             | 1,986     | 2,797.87                 |
| Loyal Customers     | 2,252     | 2,304.99                 |
| Lost Customers      | 5,408     | 1,116.00                 |
| Emerging Customers  | 7,188     | 899.84                   |

### Strategic Interpretation

- Champions generate the highest individual revenue but represent a very small portion of the base.
- Emerging Customers drive revenue through volume rather than value.
- At Risk customers have high ARPU, meaning churn directly impacts profitability.
- Revenue concentration is vulnerable due to exposure in unstable segments.
